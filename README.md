### Hi there I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://overhead.photos - A public repo where with a Raspberry Pi, Software Radio, and some old satellites in space we get new photos almost everyday of earth, automatically for free. I'm using Next.js and Python to accomplish this.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning YOLOv8 on the sidelines of my projects because of my interest in Object Detection and Machine Learning Algorithms 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a Job, I was working at farmflight.us building some really cool applications, but the company went under. Checkout my website for a copy of my Resume.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about some of my hobbies and what my favorite activity is (other than programming of course)
  
- ðŸ“« Reach me at contact@matthew-maggio.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a self taught programmer since I was 11 years old. I got into because of my interest in making mods for the popular game Minecraft.
